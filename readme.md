# MPG-MPC-PacMan

**Jakub Lepik | 239122**

A simple 3D Pac-Man-style game built fully from scratch in modern C++ and raw OpenGL üíªüî•. The game uses the [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library for image loading üì∏, [SDL3_mixer](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_mixer/FrontPage) for basic sound effects üîä, and a custom font rendering library, [glfreetype](https://github.com/benhj/glfreetype), which I modified to render FreeType fonts in 3D üé®.

This repository provides the ability to play the game right away on Windows by downloading a compiled binary or the source code from the [latest release](https://github.com/kubikulek231/MPC-MPG-PacMan/releases/tag/v1.0.0), or you can follow the [Build Instructions](#‚öôÔ∏è-build-instructions) to build the game from source! üòé

## üí• Features:
- üß± **Tile-based world**  
  - Smooth, rounded corners for cleaner-looking walls üòé
- üëª **Basic ghost AI**: Random movement with an A* algorithm for pathfinding
- üîä **Simple sounds** powered by SDL3_mixer
- üéÆ **Custom game loop**, comprehensive input handling & game logic
- üì∑ **Dynamic camera system** with options to switch to:
  - Free movement
  - Chasing player
  - Full animated board overview
- üìú **Simple menu UI**: Allows pausing and game mode selection (Sandbox or Normal)
- üåç **World sphere texture** based on image taken by [ESA Euclid satellite](https://euclid.caltech.edu/image/euclid20250319k-euclid-deep-field-fornax-preview)

## üöÄ Release

## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

The recommended way to build the project is by using Visual Studio on a Windows machine:
> The build process has been simplified using custom CMake configurations and LFS. All build and runtime dependencies, including core assets like fonts, textures, and libraries such as [NupenGL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/nupengl.core) and [SDL3_mixer](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_mixer/FrontPage), are stored in LFS. By simply cloning the repository, these assets will automatically be downloaded, extracted, and linked during the CMake configuration, making the process seamless with minimal setup required. üöÄ

1. **Clone the repository:**
    - Either download the source from [releases section](https://github.com/kubikulek231/MPC-MPG-PacMan/releases/tag/v1.0.0) or get the latest source by cloning this repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/kubikulek231/MPG-MPC-PacMan.git 
        ```
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**:
    - Open Visual Studio and use the "Open Local Folder" option to open the cloned repository directory.
    - Visual Studio will automatically detect the CMake configuration and generate the necessary build files using Ninja üõ†Ô∏è.
3. **Choose the configuration and build**:
    - Once CMake is done, select your build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release) in Visual Studio.
    - Click Build to compile the game.
4. **Run the game**:
    - After the build is complete, run the game directly from Visual Studio or locate the executable in the output directory.
